        <h3>Telling your story</h3>
        <p class="">
            I'm a Leicestershire based photographer with a passion for capturing moments and communicating stories through imagery.<br/><br/>

            Photography is hugely stylistic and when it comes to events my approach is generally to be as discrete as possible so that I can effectively capture those amazing candid moments that matter most and tell the genuine story as it unfolds.<br/><br/>
        
            If you want to see more about my work and how I see the world through my lens then please do take a look at my portfolio and if you have any questions or want to know more about my approach then please do get in touch..</p>
